#  TICKCOIN
iOS app to monitors prices and trades on Localbitcoins.
It only use public API.

I've stopped dev of this app, even if it's near to be finished (at least the iPhones version).

Feel free to end the work and to push it on the App Store, a first version was accepted when published some years ago.
There is somewhere in the code an affiliate number that you must change for yours, so people using links in the app will benefit to your affiliate program.

TODO (at least):
    - Error handler in GMSAppDelegate.m (lines 196 and 228 )
    - last sync date lost across restart
