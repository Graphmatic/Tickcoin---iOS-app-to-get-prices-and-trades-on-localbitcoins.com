#  TICKCOIN
iOS app to monitors prices and trades on Localbitcoins.
It only use public API.

I've stopped dev of this app, even if it's near to be finished (at least the iPhones version).

And as Localbitcoins will close this year, i push this app here in case someone want examples of public APIs handling in Obj-c/iOS.
TODO (at least):
    - Error handler in GMSAppDelegate.m (lines 196 and 228 )
    - last sync date lost across restart
